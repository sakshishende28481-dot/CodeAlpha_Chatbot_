# CodeAlpha_Chatbot_
This project is a basic rule-based chatbot built using simple programming logic. The chatbot works by matching user input with predefined rules and responding with fixed replies.  It does not use AI or machine learning. Instead, it checks keywords or patterns in the user’s message and gives an appropriate response based on those rules.
